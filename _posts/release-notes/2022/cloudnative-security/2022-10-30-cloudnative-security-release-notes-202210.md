### 기능 소개
Use Drilldowns on the Span Details page to link to other Oracle Cloud Infrastructure services or custom services using customizable URLs that include span attributes. On the Span Details page, you can use and edit the available drilldowns and create new ones. For more information, see View Trace or Span Details.
Save Global Filters for later use, and open and edit saved global filters from the new Saved Global Filters panel. This feature is similar to the Saved Queries feature in which a query in Trace Explorer can be saved and used at a later time to filter trace data. For more information, see Monitor Traces in Trace Explorer.
